# Instagram Only Squares
Bringing Instagram back to its square roots ðŸ˜‰

## Chrome Extension
The chrome extension simply toggles between square and rectangle, we'll let you decide which one you are... oh, I guess square is good in this case... welp, I guess I'm a square

## Installation Instructions
1. Go to chrome://extensions/
2. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right
3. Click "Load unpacked" and select your extension directory

I am awaiting approval from the Chrome Extension store, once available, I'll add the link. For the time being, just follow the instructions above :)
